<!--Text area has two attributes that are really important, 
  One is the number of rows and the other is the number of columns. 
Rows determines how tall your textarea should be.

Columns determine how wide it should be on your webpage.

When you hit the submit button after this forms, it'll take you back to the home page because when the form
was created, it had this attribute called "action" which is what should happen when you click submit..
Atm the thing there was index.html which is the home page.

The form action can be changed to a mailto in this format action= "mailto: miradmayor@gmail.com"
What mailto does is that when you hit the submit button, it opens up your default mail client
And it puts the email address that you specified
The "post" attribute in the forms simply means that we are going to transfer what the user types into the input 
fields into the email client.
After doing this, it'll open up your email app and add a bit of text to the body of your email. 

Another attribute is 'enctype' and this specifies that the data in out form is encoded in plaintext.
That way you wont have the percentage sign when the email app opens up

Another thing is adding a value to each of the 'name' attributes because that is going to identify the 
data that is inside each of these
